Course Description and Objectives
---------------------------------

This is a practical course that teaches techniques of project evaluation with special consideration for the developing world context. It also provides a critical analysis of these tools and their role in the political economy of international development. The goal is to make students adept at using and managing project evaluation.

*   Project cycle management, preconditions and assumptions, and its iterative structure.
*   Alternative planning strategies for conditions of uncertainty.
*   Organizational factors involved in developing new policies, choosing among alternatives, gaining acceptance, assuring implementation, and coping with unanticipated consequences.
*   Political environment and the interactions of clients and advisers, engineers, planners, policy analysts, and other professionals.
