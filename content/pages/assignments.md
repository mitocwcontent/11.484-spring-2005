Problem Sets
------------

Students are encouraged to form study groups of 2-3 members. However, each student must construct his / her own financial spreadsheet and write his / her own accompanying write-up. Everyone must use Excel software for their submission and leave the formulas in the cells for ease of grading. These problem sets were adapted from the teaching of Glenn Jenkins at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in 1994, and are used with many thanks.

Written Assignments
-------------------

Students will be asked to write one case study memo and one critical essay. In these assignments students will use the issues covered in the readings to critically appraise an actual project appraisal document and the use of cost-benefit tools in development.

There is no final examination in this course.
